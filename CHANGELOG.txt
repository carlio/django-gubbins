* Removed recommendation to include 'from .urls import urls' from __init__.py, as it had the potential to cause
  strange import ordering behaviour with Django. Although 'appname.urls.urls()' is a bit uglier when including in
  a urlpatterns list, it's more explicit and less fragile.

* Reinstated ability to store lists in a JSONField
